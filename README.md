This program will create subdirectories based on the file extensions and move each file to its corresponding directory.
For example, if you have files with extensions like .txt, .docx, .jpg, they will be moved to directories named txt, docx, jpg respectively.
Remember to replace "C:\Your\Directory\Path" with the path of the directory you want to organize.
